This program creates three threads that generates random numbers. When the number
is prime the thread adds the number to a global array. When the threads see
that the arrays is full, it prints its data and ends. When all the threads are
finished, the main process prints how many different numbers it received, the
smallest number and the biggest number. The threads prints how many new primes
it sent and the prime it sent most.out its data and ends.

Compile: gcc ex7a.c -o ex7a -lpthread

Run: ./ex7a

Input: No Input

Output: From threads = prime number they send the most to main process.
        From main process (ex7a) = minimum prime, max prime and number of
        different numbers in the array.

    Example:Thread -1711933696 sent 3488 different new primes.
            The prime it sent most was 1117382491, 1 times.
            Thread -1695148288 sent 39454 different new primes.
            The prime it sent most was 153105023, 1 times.
            Thread -1703540992 sent 7046 different new primes.
            The prime it sent most was 1092866087, 1 times.
            The number of different primes received is: 49987
            The max prime is: 2147429173. The min prime is: 22091

Race Mode: If 2 or more threads wait for the lock to be opened at the same time
and stop "sleeping" at the same time, both could fill the array at the same time.

The main process creates three threads and ends. The first thread receives an
integer via a global array and checks whether it is prime or not. The second
thread receives a string via a global array and checks whether the string
is a palindrome or not. The third thread reads from user p or q and then an
integer or string respectively. The thread puts the integer/string into
an appropriate global array and waits for the answer from the appropriate
thread. When it receives the answer, it prints it to the standard output.

Compile: gcc ex7b.c -o ex7b -lpthread

Run:  ./ex7b

Input: p or q. If input is p and then integer.
       If input is q and then a series of chars ending in newline.
        Example: p
                 7

Output: Whether the integer/string is a prime/palindrome.
        Example:
		is prime ? yes

Race Modes: there are no race modes here.
